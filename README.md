# Inner Melbourne Football League

In visual studio, hitting run will invoke node to process the allyears.csv file into the yeardata folder, using the splitfiles.js tool.

Otherwise, webpack will process src/index.js, into the dist folder

The dist folder also requires a copy of index.html and the yeardata folder

## TODO

* [ ] South Melbourne and Fitzroy
* [ ] Ladder
* [ ] in the finals, in the round-template, replace "Round" with "Finals week"
* [ ] if it's <=1996, fitzroy should always be included, and no option to take them out
